# happy-sad-classifier

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** to classify facial expressions as either **happy** or **sad**. This project demonstrates image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction from uploaded or file-based images.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Image preprocessing using OpenCV
- CNN architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Training on labeled "happy" and "sad" face images
- Prediction on new images (file paths or file-like objects)
- Ready for integration into web apps (e.g., Streamlit)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for data splitting and encoding)

## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the [Happy-Sad Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/billbasener/happy-sad-images) from Kaggle.

- The dataset contains labeled facial expression images stored in `happy/` and `sad/` folders.
- Download and extract it into the `dataset/` folder before training.
